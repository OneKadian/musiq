Built with Next.js and Tailwind CSS, here is a music analysis dashboard with the following sections:

## Display Cards

The dashboard features comprehensive metric cards that showcase:

- **Total Users**: The total number of registered users on the platform
- **Active Users**: The number of users who have streamed at least one song in the last 30 days

- **Revenue Distribution**: A pie chart that shows revenue breakdown from different sources (e.g., Subscriptions, Ads)
- **Top 5 Streamed Songs**: A bar chart that displays the top 5 most-streamed songs over the past 30 days
